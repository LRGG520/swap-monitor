# @endlesslabs/endless-client

This package implements a client with which you can interact with the Endless network. It can be used standalone, and it is the client package used by the Endless TypeScript SDK.

#### Implementation

The `@endlesslabs/endless-client` package supports http2 protocol and implements 2 clients environment based:

1. [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) - implemented in `index.browser.ts` to use in `browser` environment (in a browser env it is up to the browser and the server to negotiate http2 connection)
2. [got](https://github.com/sindresorhus/got) - implemented in `index.node.ts` to use in `node` environment (to support http2 in node environment, still the server must support http2 also)

#### Function signature

```ts
async function endlessClient<Res>(requestOptions: EndlessClientRequest): Promise<EndlessClientResponse<Res>>;
```

#### Types

```ts
type EndlessClientResponse<Res> = {
  status: number;
  statusText: string;

};

type EndlessClientRequest = {
  url: string;
  method: "GET" | "POST";
  body?: any;
  params?: any;
  headers?: any;
  overrides?: any;
};
```
